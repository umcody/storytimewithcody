Once upon a time, there was a small girl, Lori, living in a small village in the mountains. Her parents passed away when she was young, so she lives with her grandma and her dog. There is one secret ability Lori has. She can make anyone laugh. Whenever her grandma is having a bad day, Lori would use her ability for her grandma. This ability, however, turns out to be a curse rather than a blessing...

One day, Lori was playing with a group of children in her village. They were chasing each other and screaming as is tradition with childhood games, 
when Lori tripped on a sturdy stone. Bashing her knee into the ground, she cried out in pain. The other children looked amongst themselves, and began laughing uncontrollably.
"Stop laughing at me!" she demanded, but they couldn't. Humiliated, she sprang up and ran home.
"That was weird," one of the children said, "why couldn't I stop laughing?" he wondered.

Lori, returning home, was inconsolable in her room. Her grandma came to her room and tried to console her, but things only became worse. Her grandma could not stop
giggling! This only made things worse for Lori, so she got up and ran out of her house as far away as she could. She wound up at a local park, and sat down on the bench.
Why does no one take anything she does seriously? She felt like everyone took everything she did as a joke. She looked up at the sky and cursed, she wishes people
would take her seriously.
