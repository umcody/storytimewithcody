Once upon a time, there was a small girl, Lori, living in a small village in the mountains. Her parents passed away when she was young, so she lives with her grandma and her dog. There is one secret ability Lori has. She can make anyone laugh. Whenever her grandma is having a bad day, Lori would use her ability for her grandma. This ability, however, turns out to be a curse rather than a blessing...

One day, Lori was playing with a group of children in her village. They were chasing each other and screaming as is tradition with childhood games, 
when Lori tripped on a sturdy stone. Bashing her knee into the ground, she cried out in pain. The other children looked amongst themselves, and began laughing uncontrollably.
"Stop laughing at me!" she demanded, but they couldn't. Humiliated, she sprang up and ran home.
"That was weird," one of the children said, "why couldn't I stop laughing?" he wondered.
